# Metal Shape Solid
## Project Description

This was a small game which was expanded upon a prototype I created. It is named after the well-known stealth game known as Metal Gear Solid. I made this while I was still learning C++ so it's kinda rough on the code but is still readable and can be easily be improved.

## Gameplay
The graphics are all rendered shapes, you play as one of these as you try to sneak past the big gray circles. If you step into the light, they will come after you. You can toggle your position to another area in the map, but you will also have a cooldown timer go off each time you use it. There are also puzzle elements associated with some of these levels, as there are some switches you need to press to progress.
